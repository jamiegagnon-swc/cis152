		<h1>Maxwell House is the best coffee. &star;&star;&star;&star;&star;</h1>
		<p>My favorite type of coffee is currently Maxwell House. Not only is it light and fresh for a morning coffee brew, it's also not very acidic, so it doesn't hurt my stomach like other coffees do. I enjoy heaping creamer and a couple splenda packets ino my cup for the perfect blend of creamer, sugar, and coffee.</p>
