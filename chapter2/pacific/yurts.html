        <dt><strong>What is a Yurt?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet oﬀ the ground.
          Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden ﬂoor, and a
          roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
          gas-ﬁred stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
          and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
          facilities are located in the lodge.

        <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
          changing weather with layers of clothing. It’s also helpful to bring a
          flashlight and a sense of adventure!
